    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      Imagine you have <span class="font-semibold">€1000</span> in your bank account after paying all your monthly bills.
      You are planning for a holiday and need to make a few purchases before you leave.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      Throughout this simulation, you’ll be shown a series of items. Each time, you’ll need to decide which item to buy and whether to use your debit card or a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) option.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      Keep in mind: you must manage your budget carefully so you still have money left for your holiday!
